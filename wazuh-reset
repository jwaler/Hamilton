To **completely purge Wazuh** (including the dashboard, indexer, and agent) from a Debian/Ubuntu system, follow these steps carefully. This ensures all packages, configuration files, certificates, and user data are removed.

## ðŸ”¥ Step-by-step Wazuh Full Removal

### 1. **Stop all Wazuh services**

Run the following to stop Wazuh components:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop wazuh-manager
sudo systemctl stop wazuh-agent
sudo systemctl stop wazuh-dashboard
sudo systemctl stop wazuh-indexer
```

---

### 2. **Remove Wazuh packages**

Purge all installed packages:

```bash
sudo apt purge --autoremove wazuh-manager wazuh-agent wazuh-dashboard wazuh-indexer -y
```

You can list installed Wazuh-related packages first with:

```bash
dpkg -l | grep wazuh
```

If any extra packages show up (e.g. `opensearch`, `filebeat` if used), purge them too.

---

### 3. **Delete remaining configuration files and directories**

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/wazuh*
sudo rm -rf /var/ossec
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/wazuh*
sudo rm -rf /usr/share/wazuh*
sudo rm -rf /opt/wazuh*
sudo rm -rf /etc/systemd/system/wazuh*
sudo rm -rf /etc/wazuh-dashboard*
sudo rm -rf /usr/share/kibana*
sudo rm -rf /etc/filebeat
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/filebeat
```

Check with `ls` first if you want to confirm contents before deletion.

---

### 4. **Remove OpenSearch or Elasticsearch if installed**

If you installed Wazuh Indexer (based on OpenSearch), remove it:

```bash
sudo apt purge --autoremove opensearch -y
sudo rm -rf /etc/opensearch
sudo rm -rf /usr/share/opensearch
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/opensearch
```

---

### 5. **Reload systemd and clean up services**

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl reset-failed
```

---

### 6. **Remove any Wazuh user/group (optional)**

```bash
sudo deluser --remove-home wazuh
sudo delgroup wazuh
```

---

## âœ… Done

Your system should now be fully clean of Wazuh. You can double-check with:

```bash
sudo find / -iname '*wazuh*' 2>/dev/null
```

If anything relevant remains, remove it manually.

Let me know if you used Docker or a specific deployment method â€” the removal steps are slightly different in that case.
